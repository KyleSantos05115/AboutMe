                <p>Hello everyone, my name is William Kyle B. Santos and I am a BSIT student. I was born on March 15, 2002 in Tagumpay, a peaceful province in Gabaldon Nueva Ecija, and I study Information Technology in order to develop or create a new application/software that can entertain people, particularly gamer and new generation, aside from developing applications or software. We live a simple life on our farm, where we grow rice and vegetables. My father is a farmer who farms rice and vegetables his name is William Santos, and his life partner is my mother, a housewife who takes care of her children her name is Emmellin Barrogo, and I have a sister who is still in high school her name is Emmelline Louise Santos.</p><br>
                <p>I enjoy making miniature figurines <i>(swords, 3d layered pictures, DIY, etc.)</i>. When I get bored, I like to play the guitar, draw <i>(anime, portraits, and structures)</i>, paint, and watch anime or movies. Electricity is a skill that I learned in high school, I occasionally repair cables, lights, and speakers. I enjoy listening to pop rock, metal, acoustics, instrumental, remix, j-pop, and punk music. But I usually spend my time playing video games, watching YouTube all night, and sleeping. Also I adore cats.</p><br>
                <p>Making a game like RPG, 2D adventure, ryhtme game, and building game is most appealing to me as a player or gamer because I'm drawn to the design, the characters, and how to make it alive or playable. I also want to improve my drawing and guitar skills. As a fan of anime, I want to create a series or a noble, righteous story, as well as a character that is unlike any other. And I want to explore my talent and skills, knowing what I able to.</p><br>
                <p>Filipino content creators on YouTube inspired me to start my own gaming channel, JackGaming. I meet people who help me grow, make memories, and fall in love. Meeting new and old friends, learning new skills, and gaining new experiences.</p>
